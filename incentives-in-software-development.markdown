#Incentives and Barriers in Software Development & Design.

by Dominic Tarr (@dominictarr)

computers have come one heck of a long way in the last 100 years, but one of the 
things that gets me, is just how much room for improvement still remains.

if you have a job using computers, chances are, that you hate it. yes, there are 
those of us that love using computers, hackers, artists, a computer can be a 
powerful creative tool. but it can also be the opposite of that.

a computer system can railroad you into having to do things a particular way. 
if you can see a better way (which often, you can) this will be incredibly frustrating.

like being stuck in traffic. if things there different, you would be home by now.

it's not just computers, it's a problem with _design_. (i'm not talking about 
graphic design, I mean technical design - how things work.) largely the problem 
is bad user interfaces, but don't forget that there are also user interfaces on 
the inside.

the things you have to do to fix you car, what to crank up, what to un-bolt, 
also constitute the user interface. (just for a more advanced user)

This article is not about how to do good design, we already know how to do good 
design. it's wired into our tool making monkey brains. what this article is 
about, is why doesn't good design just happen?

And maybe how it can just happen.

the problem, unfortunately, is about the ecconomics.

A favorite example of mine, is microwave user interfaces. microwaves all do the 
same thing. And nearly every microwave user wants to do the same thing with it. 
heat stuff to eat. But microwaves nearly always have way TOO MANY BUTTONS.
I have a degree in computer science, but I often can't figure out how microwaves 
work.

Idealy a microwave should have just one button: 'MAKE HOT'. 
instead you get a veritable "bowing-cockpit" of controls. 

I'm only trying to make cheese on toast. I do not need to be able to use 80% 
power for 3 minutes and 27 seconds, EVER. _I'm only trying to make cheese on toast!_

so, microwave interfaces suck, we all know this. but why are they all like this, 
and why can't we fix them?

I'm not sure why microwaves have so many controls. It kinda makes sense in the 
early days, when they where new and exciting, and people using them to do 
actually cooking, not just heating stuff. you see alot of microwave cookbooks in 
oppertunity shops. and prehaps a microwave with more features is easier to sell, 
because there is more things for the salesman to talk about.

ok, so why can't we fix them? well, I can see what needs to be done. but there 
is whats called a barrier to entry: I don't own a microwave company, work for 
one, or know anything else about microwaves. I just know how the interface needs 
to be.

This is a real problem. This causes microwave users seconds of annoyance 
every day. that might not seem like a big deal, but this is just an example; 
the point is that bad usability, spread across many items, applicances, 
cell phones, software, websites. It all adds up to a big problem. 
It makes people hate thier jobs, it effectively shortens thier lives.

the barrier to entry to creating a better design is one obstical for good design, 
another is about incentives.

for my second example I'll talk about software, because unlike kitchen appliances, 
there is another way some software is developed: open source. 

Open Source effectively gets around the barrier to entry problem, because there 
are no manufacturing costs for software. with software, you can go from a design 
(source code) to a usable application (binary) _automaticially_. This is because 
there is a sort of computer program which can assemble the instructions for the 
machine directly from the instructions that a skilled human can give it. So if 
I give away a software design, people can replicate it for free, and also change 
make thier own changes, and also turn it into working software for free.

this is not the case for physicial devices yet. but if there where machines 
which could take a design for any kind of appliance, and build that custom 
appliance then open source appliances would be possible. (this technology is 
coming, and already there are machines which and produce arbitary circuits - of 
course it's more expensive than compiling software, because it requires physical 
materials, but it's essentially the same.)

however, open source is only half the solution. The trouble with open source 
software, is that it is lacking incentives. suppose there is a small problem 
with a piece of open source software. just something annoying, but it causes 
the user to waste 30 seconds of thier day (of course, there will be bigger 
problems too, but if we can't solve small problems how can we solve big ones?). 
Now, 30 seconds a day becomes 3 hours a year. Now suppose it may take 30 hours 
for a computer programmer to do everything they need to fix a problem, when you 
add up all the time it takes to get familiar with the workings of the software, 
to try different approches, and test thier solution. 30 hours is quite possible.

Now, if the programmer in this case is only fixing the problem for thier own 
benefit, they would only start saving time after 10 years! they probably won't 
be using that software in 10 years, so it's just not worth it.

However, what if there are 1,000 people who use that software? in one year, 
3,000 hours have been wasted. If users of the software could give improvers of 
the software just $1 for each hour they have been saved, then suddenly it would 
be incredibly lucrative to fix problems like this. programmers would compete to 
be the one to solve them! and the problems would just seem to disappear.

Of course there are big problems aswell, which naturally are worth alot more. 
but either way, there are many problems which people can see solutions to, but 
can't afford to fix, because there is no way for the solutions value to get to 
them.

Things like the app store are a huge step in the right direction, because it 
dramaticially reduces the barriers to distributing software. _but not by enough._

What we need, is a slick market place for _software features_. not just whole 
applications, but small changes to existing applications.

You need a button which says "I'm confused" and when you click on it the 
software gets more intuitive. you need to button for "I get this, okay." and 
you get a more advanced interface for more powerful users. if you don't like a 
particular widget, you can just get another.

The system would need to measure which solutions are better at what problems, 
and allow you to incentivize production of even better features.

Now, such a system doesn't exist yet, but when it does, it will  unleash a 
gold rush for value that was previously unattainable.

The central challenge to such a system, is that you can't just let anyone mess 
with your designs. If "improvements" break things, then it will waste more time 
than it could have saved, and it will be better to just pick 
the devil they know, rather than a possible lesser of two evils.

Candidate improvements need to be _automaticially tested_, so you know that the 
original application still works. breakages need to happen less than with todays 
software.

This is a hard problem, and as far as I know, has not yet been attempted.

But I belive it is possible. 

In fact, I'm working on it.
